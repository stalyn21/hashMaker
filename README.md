# Hash-Maker in the Blockchain
## Idea
Finding zeros modifying the nonce.

Our goal is to see which of the 3 algorithms is best for finding hash with zeros at the beginning of it.

## Documentation 
All these codes are a small part of the following algorithms, which you can find in https://github.com/Rytisgit/Hashing (setTransaction), https://github.com/peakstack/Simple-Blockchain (keccak), and a information security practice dictated by Oscar Chang (brute force). Furthermore, these codes were adapted for our purposes.
